### Factorial Exercise

Let's create an endpoint that will accept a number and return the original number and it's factorial. An example of 5 factorial (5!) is 5*4*3*2*1, which equal 20 (5! = 20).

To calculate the factorial, use streams and lambdas. It can be done in a single line.

Start by sketching out how the endpoint is going to work and what it's path should be.

Once you know how it should work, write a unit test then make it pass, then make a controller test and make it pass.
