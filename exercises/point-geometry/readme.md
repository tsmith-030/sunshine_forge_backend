### Challenge Exercise

Let's say we have an x-y plane. The plane can have (x,y) points, such as (3,4) or (5,1).

Create an API that takes in 2 points (x,y). Use that API to return:
* the distance between two points
* the slope between two points
* the y-intersect (where the slope crosses the y-axis)
