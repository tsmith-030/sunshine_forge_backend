### Fibonacci

**Exercise**

We're going to create an endpoint to return the [fibonacci number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) for a specific number.

This will be a function that accepts a number and will return it's fibonacci number. For example, if you give it 7, it should return 13. The response from the endpoint you're going to create should show the original value and the fibonacci number for that number.

Rather than use streams, compute the fibonacci number using **recursion**.

Keep the previous exercise in mind. Start by sketching out how the endpoint is going to work and what it's path should be.

Once you know how it should work, write a unit test then make it pass, then make a controller test and make it pass.
